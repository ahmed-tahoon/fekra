 * Runs pending Payload migrations before the build, but only when there is a

 * creates the schema. Deploying to a fresh database without this produces a
 * site where every page 500s with `relation "header" does not exist` — the
 * failure is invisible at build time and total at runtime.
 *
 * Skipping when unconfigured is what lets the holding page deploy on a project
 * that has no database yet.

 * migrate step and so the whole deploy. Nothing is wrong with the migration or
 * the schema; the pooler was busy for fifteen seconds. Applied migrations are
 * recorded in payload_migrations, so re-running is a no-op for anything that
 * already landed and a genuine failure still fails, three times, with its own
 * error on the log.
 *
 * ponytail: fixed 30s backoff. The structural fix is to point migrations at the
 * session pooler (port 5432), which is what Supabase recommends for them and
 * what stayed responsive here while 6543 stalled — set DATABASE_URL to that for
 * the build if these retries ever stop being enough.
